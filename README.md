# Word-Guess-Game

  In this project, I attempted to create a hangman game using javascript. The goal was to have a game where you could click any button to start, have a random word from the word pool come up as underscores for players to guess, have the underscores swap with letters for correct guesses and appear in the wrong guesses if the guess was wrong and decrease the remaining guesses, and update wins or losses depending on the outcome and have it restart. I was able to get the underscores to appear, but could not get past beyond that point. I coded beyond that point, but it was not working. What I struggled with Javascript was knowing what sort of process was needed, but not knowing how to actually code it. I spent many hours searching for resources and trying to understand how to get it done, but it did not come into fruition.

  For anyone wanting to make a successful hangman game, my code might come as handy as a starting point, but may just cause confusion as this is an incomplete code. The best way to make a hangman game is to just go to youtube and type up hangman with javascript and you should come across a step by step tutorial that makes the code for the game a lot simpler.
